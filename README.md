## Simple Web Apps

> I am trying to put all my web apps or apps that i created for learning or for some test cases or created just for requirement. they may be way older, may have bad code, very buggy code but they are created for some specific purpose, i tried to accomplish a task it could may be under pressure i might have written code that are hgighly vulnerbale and then later realized it.

> I am now able to understand how bugs can occur and why every software requires a `Security Testing`. Their are Sections in my app where i wanted to get the things done and without carrying about the security concern, i made sure that functionaliy can be implemented therefore resulting into getting bugs introuduced. You can say High Severity Bugs.

> Their are few Apps which are created vulnerable by design since i have used it for some testing and demonstration purpose.
